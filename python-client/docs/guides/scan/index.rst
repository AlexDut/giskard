üîç Scan your ML model
===============

Before embarking on testing Machine Learning models, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the critical vulnerabilities that can impact your model. The Giskard scan is designed to automatically detect various significant risks associated with your ML model. Learn more about vulnerabilities

By conducting a Giskard scan, you can proactively identify and address these vulnerabilities, ensuring the reliability, fairness, and robustness of your Machine Learning models.


Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^

To scan your ML model for vulnerabilities, you need:

- A **Giskard dataframe** composed of the examples you want to scan. To wrap your dataset, see `here <../wrap_dataset/index.html>`_.
- A **Model**. For example, a model from *scikit-learn*, *Tensorflow*, *HuggingFace*, *catboost*, *PyTorch*, ... or even
  any set of *Python* functions. To wrap your model, see `here <../wrap_model/index>`_.


Scan your model to detect vulnerabilities
^^^^^^^^^

After having wrapped your `model <../wrap_model/index>`_ & `dataset <../wrap_dataset/index>`_, ou can scan your model for vulnerabilities using:

.. code-block:: python

    from giskard import demo, Model, Dataset, scan

    model, df = demo.titanic()

    wrapped_model = Model(model=model, model_type="classification")
    wrapped_dataset = Dataset(df=df, target="Survived", cat_columns=['Pclass', 'Sex', "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"])

    scan_results = scan(wrapped_model, wrapped_dataset)

    display(scan_results)  # in your notebook

In the notebook, this will produce a widget that allows you to explore the detected issues:

.. image:: ../../assets/scan_results.png

You can also get a table of the scan results as a `pandas.DataFrame`. This is useful if you want to save the results of
the scan to a CSV or HTML file.

.. code-block:: python

    results_df = scan_results.to_dataframe()
    results_df.to_csv("scan_results_my_model.csv")


Automatically generate a test suite based on the scan results
^^^^^^^^^

If the automatic scan with `giskard.scan` found some issues with your model, you can automatically generate a set of
tests (a test suite) that will reproduce those issues.

.. code-block:: python

    test_suite = scan_results.generate_test_suite("My first test suite")

    # You can run the test suite locally to verify that it reproduces the issues
    test_suite.run()

Upload your test suite in the Giskard server
^^^^^^^^^

You can then upload the test suite to Giskard server. This will enable you to:

* Compare models to decide which model to promote
* Debug your tests to diagnose the issues
* Create more domain-specific tests that are integrating business feedback
* Share your results

.. code-block:: python

    #Uploading the test suite will automatically save the model, dataset, tests, slicing & transformation functions inside the Giskard UI server
    # Create a Giskard client aftern having install the Giskard server (see documentation)
    token = "API_TOKEN"  # Find it in Settings in the Giskard server
    client = GiskardClient(
        url="http://localhost:19000",  # URL of your Giskard instance
        token=token
    )

    my_project = client.create_project("my_project", "PROJECT_NAME", "DESCRIPTION")

    # Upload to the current project ‚úâÔ∏è
    test_suite.upload(client, "my_project")
    
For more information about uploading to the Giskard server, go to the [Upload an object to the Giskard server](../upload/index) page.

.. hint:: Uploading the test suite

   Uploading the test suite will automatically save the model, dataset, tests, slicing & transformation functions inside the Giskard UI server.
