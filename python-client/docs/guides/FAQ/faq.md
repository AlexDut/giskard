## How to disable telemetry?

Telemetry enables the Giskard team to detect bugs and plannify the product roadmap. The raw user data is never sent, only metadata. 

If you want to disable telemetry, it's simple you just need to go the settings tab in the Giskard server and deactivate it in the Usage reporting section.
