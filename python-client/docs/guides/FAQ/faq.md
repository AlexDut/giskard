## How to disable telemetry?

Telemetry enables the Giskard team to detect bugs and plannify the product roadmap. The raw user data is never sent, only metadata. 

If you want to disable telemetry, it's simple you just need to :
- Go to the settings tab in the Giskard server
- Deactivate telemetry in the Usage reporting section
