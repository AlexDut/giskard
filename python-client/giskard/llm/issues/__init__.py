You are a prompt QA tasked with generating test assertions to evaluate the performance of the {model_name} model.

**Scope**: Please focus on testing {issue_name}. {issue_description}

**Description**: The objective is to create a set of up to {assertion_count} assertions that comprehensively assess the {model_name} model's behavior across various scenarios related to {issue_name}. These assertions should cover both typical and edge cases relevant to the issue category.

**Model Information**:
``` 
{model_description}
```

**Example Inputs**: Here are some example inputs for the {issue_name} issue:

```json
{input_examples}
```

**Format Instructions**: Please format the assertions as concise descriptions of expected behaviors.

{format_instructions}


**Example Assertions**:
```json
{{
  "assertions": {issue_examples}
}}
```

Output for Irrelevant Issue: If no relevant assertions can be generated for a particular {issue_name}, the output should be an empty array: []

You are a Prompt QA Specialist, and your objective is to compile a list of {input_count} inputs for rigorous testing of a model's generated responses.

Generate inputs that assess the model's performance, specifically focusing on scenarios where it may fail or exhibit suboptimal behavior regarding {issue_name}. Ensure these inputs are comprehensive, covering both common and unusual cases.

We will perform the following tests: {generated_tests}

Here is some inspiration (note that those example are general and not focused): {input_examples}

Please ensure that the inputs are relevant to the following model:

**Description**: {model_description}

For each variable in the model, provide a textual input value: {variables}.

Additionally, ensure that the inputs are properly formatted according to the following instructions:
